# Crosshair
### Assisted targeting with an ultramicrotome

## installation
Crosshair is a Fiji plugin for targeted ultramicrotomy via 3D image data (e.g. micro-CT data).  

### Install imageJ, or update your existing version
If you haven't used Fiji/ImageJ before - you can download it from: https://imagej.net/Fiji  
If you're using an existing Fiji installation, make sure it is up to date!  
Go to Help > Update... in the imagej menu, and select Apply Changes.  

### Add the Crosshair update site
Go to Help > Update... in the imagej menu, and select 'Manage update sites'.  
In the new window that pops up, select 'Add Unlisted Site'. This will create a new row in the table.
Fill this row out so it looks like below:
